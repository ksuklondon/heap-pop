# Heap

`Heap` class - binary max heap.

The solution consist of projects:
* _HeapLib_ - library containing `Heap` class,
* _HeapUnitTest_ - unit test for `Heap` class,
* _HeapApp_ - application that uses the `Heap` class.

## Task: Heap-pop
Implement `Heap` `pop` methods that removes the key value pair with the greatest key value (root of the heap).

Tip: When implementing the `pop` method use the `heapify` method.
